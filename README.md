This repository solves few vulnerable use cases where in classical computing

# exact use case
In this repository I'm going to capture the detailed information about the quantum bits, basically in classical computing a bit can represent true or false but when you use quantum it can be represent same at a time and provides an accurate answer way more faster(can't imaging) than the classical computer.
